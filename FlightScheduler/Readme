Read Me file for Flight Scheduler 
----------------------------------

FlightScheduler uses a shortest path algorithm to calculate the shortest flight path between any two cities.  

FlightScheduler takes 3 arguments: 
1)a list of all airport codes and their timezone relative to gmt,
2)a list of flights (flight#, departure city/time, arrival city/time), and 
3)a flight query listing one start city followed by one or more destination from that starting city.  

Following files, 
1. Airport File : airport.txt 
2. Flight File : flight.txt 
3. Query file : query.txt
are included to facilitate easy testing of the programming and as a template for new lists.

Major Classes and files used:
Package: com.lokesh.airline
